	// Place your snippets for cpp here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Boilerplate": {
		"prefix": "boilerplate",
		"body": [
			"#include<iostream>",
			"using namespace std;",
			"int main(){",
			" \t$1",
			" cout<<",
			"return 0;"

			"}"

			
			
		],
		"description": "this is boiler plate for using include and making simple commands"

	"inta": {
		"prefix":  "inta",
		"body": [
		  "",
		  "int a ,b ,c ;",
		  ""

		"description": "this is multiple int variabe maker"

	  "this is simple cout ": {
